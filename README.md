# Mobile Flashcards

This iOS app let's you create multiple flashcards decks with multiple questions in each deck. On one side of the flashcard the question is shown and on the otherside the answer, which can be revealed by tapping on the card. Furthermore you can indicate wether you had the question correct or incorrect by tapping on the thumbs up and thumbs down button.

Note that the app is only tested on iOS using a simulator
